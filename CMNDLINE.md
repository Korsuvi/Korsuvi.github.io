## The commandline-course
This course is about command line tools. Command line tools are useful for a linguists doing corpus related work on python or other languages and environments. 
In this course we have learned basics, like updating and running programs, to more advanced subjects, like advanced corpus processing. 


## What did I lear? 




### * Week 1: Command-line environment
  * mkdir, cd, mv, wget, ls, emacs, less 
  * This week we made sure we could use our command line environment, and started with basic commands to make our lifes easier.

### * Week 2: Navigating a UNIX System
  * gzip, tar, scp
  * this week i was sick, so i donÂ´t remember much, and didnÂ´t do the quiz.

### * Week 3: Basic Corpus Processing
  * utf-8 encoding
  * N files
  * egrep, wc
  * This week we learned abut text encding, differencies between them and dove into egrep and N files
  
### * Week 4: Advanced Corpus Processing
  * sed 
  * regular expression
  * UNIX and pipe |
  * This week we took on regex and sed. I was already familiar with regex, but needed the recap. 
  
### * Week 5: Scripting and Configuration Files
  * scripts
  * echo, export
  * This week was difficult, scripts are hard for me. 
  
### * Week 6: Installing and Running Programs
  * sudo, brew
  * pip, uploading using pip
  * creating Makefile and running it
  * In this week, we learned why we use brew on mac and what pip is really about.
  
### * Week 7: Version Control
  * version control using Github
  * repository set up, cloning, commit and push changes
  * Github and repositorys were this weekÂ´s subject. Github was a new thing for me, and i was suprised how it is used with bash. I liked the idea of having all changes be visible if wanted.
  
### * Final project
  * jekyll, markdown
  * On final project, we learned more about Github and markdown. Markdown seems like a basic version of html, but also very user-friendly.
