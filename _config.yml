at least one list, image and table 
You should write a short overall introduction to the course and one section for every week (for the final week, you can talk about Jekyll and Gihub Pages).
Please use appropriate headers for each section.
You should briefly describe the main content of each week and also briefly reflect on what you learned during the week (maybe 1-3 sentences for reflection)
